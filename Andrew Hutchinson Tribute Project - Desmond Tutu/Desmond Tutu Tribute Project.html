    <h3>Some Background on the Archbishop:</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing you have to understand about Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is
      that he is hero in his own right. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in no small manner of saying, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in
      recognition of the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        ><b
          >"the courage and heroism shown by black South Africans in their time
          with the peaceful method of struggle against apartheid."</b
        ></i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      On October 7th 1931, Desmond Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, in the South
      African state of Transvaal. The family moved to Johannesburg when he was
      12, and he attended Johannesburg Bantu High School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he had planned to become a physician, his parents could not
      afford to send him to medical school.
    </p>
    <p>In 1954, Desmond Tutu Graduates from the University of South Africa.</p>
    <p>
      When the government ordained a deliberately inferior system of education
      for black students, Desmond Tutu refused to cooperate. He could no longer
      work as a teacher, but he was determined to do something to improve the
      life of his disenfranchised people. On the advice of his bishop, he began
      to study for the Anglican priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>In 1960, Desmond Tutu is ordained as a priestin the Anglican church.</p>
    <p>
      Desmond Tutu goes on to fight the opression of Aparthied that grips the
      country, and never gives up on his mission of peace between all.

      A final word by the Archbishop, which, in my opinion, encapsulates the man
      quite aptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Without forgiveness, <b>there's no future."</b></i>
    </p>
